# Applied-Programming-Lab-EE2703
These are the assignments done for a computing course in my institute, IIT Madras as a part of my EE degree. 

APPLIED PROGRAMMING LAB

Description : After finishing this course students will 
* have a working knowledge of scientific python 
* able to do linear Least Squares fitting 
* able to model and simulate simple systems 
* have a practical knowledge of signal processing  

Course Content : 
* Introduction to Scientific Python 
* Least Squares (curve fitting)
* Simulating in time - Tubelight (Monte Carlo modelling)
* Simulating a device - Laplace's equation, ampere's law (Sympy and Signals module)
* Using the system module to solve for step and impulse response of op-amp circuits 
* Using the DFT to obtain steady state response of linear (and op-amp) circuits 
* Simulating noise in circuits 
* Low pass filtering of signals using digital filters. Effect on SNR
