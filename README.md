These are the assignments done for a computing course in my institute, IIT Madras as a part of my EE degree. Description : After finishing this course students will * have a working knowledge of scientific python * able to do linear Least Squares fitting * able to model and simulate simple systems * have a practical knowledge of signal processing  Course Content : * Introduction to Scientific Python * Least Squares * Simulating in time - Tubelight * Simulating a device - Laplace's equation, ampere's law * Using the system module to solve for step and impulse response of op-amp circuits * Using the DFT to obtain steady state response of linear (and op-amp) circuits * Simulating noise in circuits * Low pass filtering of signals using digital filters. Effect on SNR
